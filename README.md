# 🛍️ Myntra Online Retail Customer Segmentation
### 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Customer Segmentation for Myntra Gifts Ltd. using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering algorithms. The goal is to group customers into meaningful segments for targeted marketing, customer retention, and business growth.

### 📊 Dataset
**Source:** Myntra Gifts Ltd. Online Retail Data (Dec 2009 – Dec 2011)
**Records:** 541,909 transactions
- **Key Columns:**
  - InvoiceNo – Unique invoice number
  - StockCode – Product code
  - Description – Product description
  - Quantity – Units purchased
  - InvoiceDate – Date of purchase
  - UnitPrice – Price per unit
  - CustomerID – Unique customer identifier
  - Country – Customer’s location

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Techniques:
  - RFM Analysis
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)
  - DBSCAN
  - Elbow Method & Silhouette Score for model selection

### 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates and cancelled orders (InvoiceNo starting with "C")
- Handled missing values (Description, CustomerID)
- Filtered negative quantities & prices
- Created Revenue = Quantity × UnitPrice
- Extracted day, month, year, hour from InvoiceDate
- Scaled RFM values before clustering

### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Visualizations created:**
- Top 10 Most Sold Products
- Top 10 Products by Revenue
- Monthly Sales Trends
- Customer Segmentation by Purchase Frequency
- Sales by Country
- Hourly Purchase Patterns
- Sales by Day of Week
- Hourly Purchases for Top 10 Countries
- RFM Distribution Analysis
- Cluster Distribution Visualization

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- K-Means Clustering (Final Model)
- Optimal clusters determined using Elbow Method & Silhouette Score (0.52)
- Segments customers into high-value, potential churners, and occasional buyers
- Hierarchical Clustering – Validated relationships via dendrograms
- DBSCAN – Identified outliers & noise

### 📊 Key Results
- 3 optimal clusters identified for targeted marketing campaigns
- High-value customers account for ~20% of customers but ~60% of revenue
- Churn-prone customers identified for re-engagement campaigns

### 💡 Business Impact
- Targeted marketing improves retention by ~30%
- Proactive engagement reduces churn risk
- Efficient marketing budget allocation improves ROI

### 🚀 Conclusion
The segmentation model enables Myntra to personalize campaigns, increase retention, and optimize resource allocation. K-Means clustering proved to be the most efficient model for this dataset.
